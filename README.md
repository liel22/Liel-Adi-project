# This Work is done by Liel forish and Adi meller for Second year semester project.
The Java Vehicle Agency project aims to develop a comprehensive vehicle management system with a graphical user interface (GUI). The system includes various types of vehicles, such as water vehicles, air vehicles, 
and amphibious vehicles capable of operating on both land and water.
The GUI provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.
It allows them to perform tasks such as adding new vehicles, editing vehicle details, searching for specific vehicles, and generating reports.




Throughout the project, several challenges may have been encountered,
such as designing an efficient data structure for storing and retrieving vehicle information, implementing validation and error handling to ensure data integrity,
and ensuring a smooth integration between the GUI and the underlying functionality.
